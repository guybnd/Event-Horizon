# Event Horizon Agent — Orchestrator

Version: 2.4.0

## Overview

Event Horizon is a local-first ticket board backed by markdown files. Tickets are stored either in `.flux/` (in-repo mode) or `.flux-store/` (orphan-branch mode using a git worktree on `flux-data`). The engine abstracts this — agents interact exclusively through MCP tools and never touch ticket files directly.

## Skill Routing

| Ticket Status | Load Skill |
|---|---|
| `Grooming`, `Require Input` | grooming skill |
| `Todo`, `In Progress` | implementation skill |
| Release orchestration | release skill |
| Cross-project mapping (multi-repo group) | mapping skill |

Read-only tasks (explanation, search, discussion) need no phase skill.

## Ticket Model

Tickets have these fields (relevant when calling `update_ticket` or reading `get_ticket` output):

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | e.g. `FLUX-41` — set by engine, never change |
| `title` | string | Short description |
| `status` | string | Board column (e.g. `Grooming`, `Todo`, `In Progress`, `Ready`, `Done`) |
| `priority` | string | `None`, `Low`, `Medium`, `High`, `Critical` |
| `effort` | string | `None`, `XS`, `S`, `M`, `L`, `XL` |
| `assignee` | string | User name or `unassigned` |
| `tags` | string[] | From board config |
| `body` | markdown | Description / plan in the ticket body |
| `subtasks` | string[] | Child ticket IDs — use `create_subtask` to add |
| `implementationLink` | string | Commit hash or PR URL — set by `finish_ticket` |
| `branch` | string | Git branch name (e.g. `flux/FLUX-41-add-effort-field`) — set by `create_branch` or portal Start Task prompt |

History is an append-only event log (types: `comment`, `status_change`, `activity`, `agent_session`). You read it via `get_ticket` and append to it via `add_comment`, `change_status`, `log_progress`. Never construct history entries manually.

## Working Surfaces

- Ticket storage: `.flux/` (in-repo) or `.flux-store/` (orphan mode) — agents NEVER access these directly
- Board config: `config.json` in the active flux directory
- Project docs: `.docs/**/*.md`
- Engine source: `engine/src/`
- Portal source: `portal/src/`
- Skill sources: `.docs/skills/*.md`
- Skill templates: `.flux/skills/*.md`

## APIs

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/tasks` | List all tickets |
| `POST /api/tasks` | Create a ticket |
| `PUT /api/tasks/:id` | Update a ticket |
| `DELETE /api/tasks/:id` | Delete a ticket |
| `POST /api/tasks/:parentId/subtasks` | Create a linked subtask |
| `GET /api/config` | Get board config |
| `PUT /api/config` | Update board config |
| `POST /api/bulk-rename` | Bulk rename statuses/tags |

Portal: `localhost:5167` — Engine: `localhost:3067`

## User Input Routing

- Chat for broad discussion. Ticket system for ticket-specific decisions.
- `Require Input` → history comment with one clear question + proposed defaults → user answers → route back to next status.
- `Ready` → user reviews → `finish <ticket>` → agent commits + closes atomically.

## Ticket Resolution

- `FLUX-41` → use that ticket. Bare number like `41` or `do 41` → resolve to `FLUX-41`.
- Repo-changing work without a named ticket → find or create a ticket first.
- Pure explanation, brainstorming, or read-only discussion does not require ticket state changes.

## Persisting Changes — CRITICAL

All ticket updates — status changes, metadata, body rewrites, history comments — **MUST** use the MCP tools listed below.

**NEVER do any of the following:**
- Use the `Write` tool on any file in `.flux/` or `.flux-store/`
- Use the `Edit` tool on any file in `.flux/` or `.flux-store/`
- Use `Bash` with `echo`, `sed`, `cat >`, or any shell command that writes to ticket files
- Use `curl` to hit the REST API when MCP tools are available
- Construct YAML frontmatter manually and write it to disk

The MCP tools handle schema validation, timestamps, history normalization, and portal sync. Direct file writes bypass all of this and can corrupt tickets.

### MCP Tools (use these — they appear in your tool list)

| Tool | Use When |
|---|---|
| `get_ticket` | Reading a ticket's full state (frontmatter + body + history) |
| `list_tickets` | Finding tickets by status, assignee, tag, or priority |
| `get_board_config` | Checking valid statuses, tags, project key |
| `create_ticket` | Creating a new ticket |
| `create_subtask` | Creating a child ticket linked to a parent |
| `update_ticket` | Changing metadata (title, priority, effort, tags, assignee, body) |
| `change_status` | Moving to a new status (comment required for Require Input/Ready) |
| `add_comment` | Adding a comment to ticket history |
| `log_progress` | Logging a progress update |
| `finish_ticket` | Completing a ticket (sets implementationLink + Done atomically) |
| `create_branch` | Create a git feature branch for a ticket (`flux/<ID>-<slug>`) and store its name on the ticket |
| `get_branch` | Get branch name + existence + ahead/behind counts vs master |
| `delete_branch` | Delete the branch associated with a ticket (refuses unmerged unless `force: true`) |

Notes:
- `change_status` enforces comment requirements: you MUST provide a `comment` when transitioning to `Require Input` (the question) or `Ready` (the completion summary).
- `finish_ticket` is atomic: it sets the implementation link, adds a completion comment, and moves status to Done in one operation. When the ticket has a `branch`, it also pushes the branch and creates a PR via `gh` — the PR URL becomes the `implementationLink`.
- `create_subtask` creates a child ticket file and links it to the parent's `subtasks` array atomically.
- All tools handle timestamps, history normalization, and schema validation server-side.
- There is **no** `switch_branch` tool. Agents stay on their ticket branch for the full session. Switching branches requires explicit user confirmation in chat.

### REST API (last-resort fallback)

ONLY use the REST API if MCP tools genuinely fail to load (i.e., `ToolSearch` returns no `event-horizon` tools). If MCP tools appear in your tool list, use them — never fall back to curl/REST "for convenience."

REST base: `http://localhost:3067`

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/tasks` | Create a ticket |
| `PUT` | `/api/tasks/:id` | Update a ticket (use `appendHistory` for comments) |
| `POST` | `/api/tasks/:parentId/subtasks` | Create a linked subtask |

If neither MCP tools nor the API are reachable, surface the problem to the user and wait. Do not edit files directly under any circumstances.

Ticket changes that only exist in chat or agent memory are **lost**. The engine is the single source of truth.

## Critical Rules

- NEVER use Write, Edit, or Bash to modify files in `.flux/` or `.flux-store/`. These paths are engine-managed.
- Treat ticket files as schema-sensitive. The engine validates and rejects malformed writes.
- Do not delete ticket history; append only.
- The `finish <ticket>` handoff is required before committing. Commit creation, `implementationLink` update, and status → `Done` happen as one atomic step.
- **Reference docs (`.docs/event-horizon/reference/*`) are kept in sync with code.** If the ticket changes ticket-schema, MCP tools, REST endpoints, realtime channels, or the agent-adapter contract, the matching reference page MUST be updated in the same ticket. Fix the drift; do not file a follow-up.

## End-to-End Checklist

- Ticket read fully — Relevant docs reviewed — Plan comment added
- Grooming produced a concrete plan with filled metadata
- Implementation-critical choices clarified before coding
- Status moved at the right time — Code changed in smallest surface — Validation passed
- **Docs refreshed before `Ready`/`Done` — reference pages match the new behavior, code-map points at any new modules, and the completion comment says either "docs updated: …" or "no docs needed because …"**
- Questions went through `Require Input`, not only chat
- `finish <ticket>` received before commit — Completion comment added — Status → `Done`
