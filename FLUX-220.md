      Grooming complete. Ticket is now `Todo` with the body rewritten as the
      implementation plan. The API response confirms the `Grooming → Todo`
      status change was recorded.


      **Summary:** FLUX-220 is groomed and moved to `Todo`. Plan: add
      `migrateStrandedFluxTickets()` to `storage-sync.ts` (copies stranded
      `.flux/*.md` → `.flux-store/` on startup when orphan mode is active, then
      deletes originals), and call it from `activateWorkspace` before `initDir`.
      Ready to implement when you say go.

## Implementation Plan

### Problem
When orphan mode is active (`.flux-store/` exists), `activateWorkspace` calls `initDir()` which reads from `getActiveFluxDir()` — i.e. `.flux-store/`. Any `.flux/*.md` ticket files that were not migrated are invisible to the engine. Subsequent writes to those tickets fail silently because `_path` in the task cache would point to `.flux/` which is never loaded.

### Solution
Add a `migrateStrandedFluxTickets(workspaceRoot: string): Promise<void>` function in `engine/src/storage-sync.ts` that:
1. Early-returns if orphan mode is NOT active (`.flux-store/` doesn`t exist)
2. Reads all `.md` files from `.flux/`
3. For each one, copies it to `.flux-store/` (skip if destination already exists — don`t overwrite newer data)
4. Deletes the source from `.flux/` after successful copy
5. Also migrates `config.json` from `.flux/` → `.flux-store/` if `.flux-store/config.json` does not yet exist
6. Logs each migrated file with `[startup-migrate]` prefix

Call `migrateStrandedFluxTickets(newRoot)` from `activateWorkspace` in `engine/src/task-store.ts`, after `attachWorktreeIfPresent(newRoot)` and before `initDir()`.

### Touchpoints
- `engine/src/storage-sync.ts` — add exported function
- `engine/src/task-store.ts` — import and call in `activateWorkspace`

### Validation
- Manually: put a `.md` ticket in `.flux/` while `.flux-store/` exists, restart engine, verify the ticket appears in `/api/tasks` and the `.flux/` file is gone
- No automated test needed for this scope
